        Hey there -- I'm Suzanne Wen, a senior at Rice University. Thanks so much for visiting my website! This is an ongoing side project I've been working on ever since I discovered my love for web development & design at my summer internship just a few months ago. So now, going into my 4th and last year, I've decided to pursue this passion and seek opportunities for web development in my future career.<br><br>
        In this website, you'll find a brief bio about me (you're here now!), an abreviated timeline of my life, a gallery of my photography, and a blog of my random thoughts (in progress). <br><br>
        Check out my resume &nbsp; <a href="assets/components/suzannewen_resume.pdf"><i class="fi-page-pdf" style="font-size: 20px; color: black;"></i></a><br>

      <div class="small-12 columns text questions">
          <p class="titles">Why do I have this website?</p>
          <p class="info">This past summer, at my internship, I discovered I absolutely love web development. I've always had a creative side while also eager to seek a technical challenge, and, to me, front-end web development was the perfect mashup of the two. So now, going into my senior year, I've decided to pursue this passion and seek opportunities for web development in my future career.</p>
          <p class="titles"><br>Wait, aren't you studying engineering?</p>
          <p class="info">Yes, and I don't regret it. Although bioengineering is far from a computer science degree, it has taught me invaluable skills on how to work on a team, tackle immensely difficult problems step-by-step, learn rapidly, and present my work effectively and professionally.</p>
          <p class="titles"><br>What else should I know about you?</p>
          <p class="info">There are two things that drive me. The first is pursuing my passions. I want to look back on my entire life and smile because I know I chased after the things that really matter to me vs. just settling down for a comfortable life. My second priority is loving people. I continuously aspire to be more and more selfless with my time, finances, and energy in order to care for other people.</p>
