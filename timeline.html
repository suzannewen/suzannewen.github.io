          <h3>humble beginnings</h3>
          <p>I spent the most formative time of my youth in a little city named Arlington, TX. Since freshmen year, I dreamed of going to Rice University, and this drove me to try my very hardest in school. I loved all my science classes - physics, chemistry, biology - and this led me the obvious choice of engineering going into college.</p>

          <h3><b>2013 </b><br> college days</h3>
          <p>I can honestly can say that my years here have been the best of my life. College changed me into a whole new person and straightened out my priorities in life. I can't say enough about how incredible Rice is - my peers inspire me everyday with their intelligence and ambition to change the world. Rice gives its students a fantastic education, but it shapes us even more by empowering us to tackle the world's biggest problems.</p>

          <h3><b>present </b><br> career changes</h3>
          <p>Thoughout the last 3+ years, I've explored many career options, from going to grad school, working at a biotech start-up, and finally stumbling upon web development. So here I am, changing my career path one last time as I start senior year. It's scary, but I've found the industry that I'm passionate about. And I think chasing your passion is almost the most important thing a young adult can do for themselves.</p>

          <p>It's coming so soon! It will be hard for me to say goodbye to the magical place which is Rice. I've never been happier... but I'm ready to step outside this comfortable bubble, explore all the opportunities out there, and grow my skillset.</p>
